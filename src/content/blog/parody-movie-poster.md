### Description
This project is a personal project focused on creating a parody poster design for the film ‘Tinggal Meninggal’. In this parody version, the poster title has been changed to ‘Tinggal Wisuda’ to evoke a sense of humor and satire. The creative process involved digital imaging techniques and image manipulation, resulting in a visual composition that resembles the original film poster but with the distinctive comedic touch characteristic of parody style.
