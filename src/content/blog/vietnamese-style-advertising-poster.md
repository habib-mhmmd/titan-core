### Description

This project is a personal exploration in poster design inspired by Vietnamese advertising style, characterized by bright visuals, strong contrasts, and an optimistic atmosphere. I applied digital image processing techniques and photo manipulation to create dynamic and eye-catching compositions. This poster promotes GoTo services, highlighting energy, enthusiasm, and positivityâ€”elements commonly found in Vietnamese street advertising and billboards. This work also serves as a creative experiment in blending local identity with international design styles.
