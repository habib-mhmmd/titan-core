### Description
This project focuses on developing 3D animation visualization as a medium to represent the design of the Arena E-Sport Volume 5 Community Jersey, which has not yet been physically produced. By utilizing CLO3D for modeling and simulation, as well as Blender for animation and rendering, this jersey visualization is presented with high-quality and realistic details. The use of camera movement techniques adds a cinematic dimension, enhancing the visual appeal of the design. This approach aims to provide a more professional and realistic representation, while also serving as an effective medium for introducing the product and strengthening the image of the E-Sport Arena Community within the esports ecosystem.
