### Description
This project featured a 3D visualization for the Arena E-Sport Community vol. 5 jersey design, which was yet to be physically produced. By utilizing CLO3D for modeling and Blender for animation and rendering, the jersey design was visualized in detail with a realistic and high-quality appearance. In addition to highlighting design details, this visualization is enriched with cinematic camera movements to give a professional impression. The result is not only a media presentation of the design, but also a promotional tool that strengthens the identity of Arena E-Sport Community before the jersey is officially produced.
